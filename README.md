> ‚ö†Ô∏è Tipi is still at an early stage of development and issues are to be expected. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you find a bug.

Tipi is a personal homeserver orchestrator. It is running docker containers under the hood and provides a simple web interface to manage them. Every service comes with an opinionated configuration in order to remove the need for manual configuration and network setup.
